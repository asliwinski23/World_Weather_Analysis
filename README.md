# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to become comfortable working with APIs. In this repo I worked with OpenWeatherMaps API and Google Maps APIs.

I randomly selected 2,000 coordinates, from which I used citipy to find the nearest city to these points. There were only about 700 cities returned.

From those 700 cities, I further filtered the city list based off of temperature (60-80 degrees farenheit).

Then, I found four cities near each other and created a travel routing itinerary. The cities I selected are in Australia.

The routing map I created can be found below:

The marker map I created can be found below:
